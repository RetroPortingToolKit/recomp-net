/*
 * RNET_LOBBY_GAME_VERSION (or <legacy prefix>GAME_VERSION, e.g.
 * SNES_NET_GAME_VERSION) -- pin the announced version for one run.
 *
 * The derived pin deliberately makes two builds match ONLY when they really
 * are the same build: a clean release is its tag, and a development build
 * carries its commit plus a hash of its uncommitted diff. That is what stops
 * two peers whose trees differ from pairing and then desyncing, and it must
 * stay the default for anyone who does not ask otherwise.
 *
 * But it also makes DEVELOPMENT testing awkward. Two machines mid-change are
 * exactly the pair that will not match, and reconfiguring both to agree means
 * a CMake cache edit and a rebuild on each -- for a run whose whole purpose is
 * to test the change that made them differ.
 *
 * So the override is here, deliberately as an environment variable: it is
 * per-run rather than baked into an artifact, it takes an explicit act on both
 * machines, and it announces itself loudly enough that nobody mistakes an
 * overridden build for an honest one. It is a TESTING tool. Two peers who set
 * it to the same string are asserting their builds agree; the runtime cannot
 * check that for them, and a desync under an override is the answer to a
 * question the override asked.

 * alters the simulation cannot hide from it. Until now that signal was
 * computed, named down to the subsystem, printed to a local log, and thrown
 * away. Reporting it is what turns a detection nobody sees into evidence
 * somebody can act on.
 *
 * A fork is NOT an accusation and this call must never be written as though
 * it were. It says two peers disagreed. Version skew says that. A genuine
 * emulation bug says that -- this project has found several, and each one
 * would have produced these reports from two entirely honest players. Which
 * side MOVED is unknowable from either end of a two-peer disagreement, and is
 * only ever answerable by looking at many matches against many opponents,
 * which is a thing a server with accounts can do and a client cannot. So both
 * digests go on the wire, both peers report independently, and the server
 * stores rather than judges.
 *
 * Best-effort: a report that cannot be sent is dropped rather than retried or
 * queued. A desync usually ends the match, the connection often goes with it,
 * and making a diagnostic hold a teardown open would be a worse bug than the
 * missing row.
