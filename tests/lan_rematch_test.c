/*
 * A LAN / Direct IP room across a soft return: the socket lifecycle a rematch
 * walks, over the real RNETDJ1 waiting room on loopback, single-threaded.
 *
 * What a rematch does to the room, in order: START goes out, BOTH sockets
 * close (the game session takes the port), the match runs, and then the host
 * re-opens its listener while the guest -- which has no socket left -- asks
 * for its seat again. This proves the pieces that makes work:
 *
 *   1. the non-blocking join (join_begin / join_poll) seats a guest while the
 *      caller keeps pumping the host on the same thread;
 *   2. START carries the session id the host allocated, so both peers launch
 *      the same fresh id and a rematch does not reuse the last one;
 *   3. a guest asking while the host is NOT listening yet keeps asking
 *      (PENDING), and is seated once the host re-opens with the seat freed;
 *   4. a seated guest whose JOIN_OK was lost and asks again is answered, not
 *      refused its own seat as "full"; another guest IS refused "full";
 *   5. a LEAVE from anyone but the seated guest does not empty the seat;
 *   6. the registry file carries the session id, and a file written without
 *      one reads as 0.
