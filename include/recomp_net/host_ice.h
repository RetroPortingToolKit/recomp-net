/*
 * Host relay over ICE: the waiting-room proof.
 *
 * The host carries the match for its room (it is the hub; see
 * rnet_session_start_ice_hub). Before the match, each guest has to PROVE it
 * can reach the host, and the proof is the same thing the match will use: a
 * real ICE agent pair.
 *
 *   HOST   one answerer agent per currently seated guest. Agents are added
 *          and removed as members join / leave / move seats, and each binds
 *          an ephemeral port (never a fixed one: N agents cannot share it).
 *   GUEST  one offerer agent whose peer is the host.
 *
 * Roles are fixed: the host answers, guests offer. No TURN and no
 * force-relay -- a hub agent that cannot connect directly is a failure, and
 * the lobby server's relay carries the match instead.
 *
 * Signalling rides the lobby `signal` op addressed with to_player_id, in its
 * own type range so it cannot collide with the legacy game ICE (1-6), the
 * RTT probe (100-102), or mod transfer (110/111, 121-126):
 *
 *     wire type = RNET_LOBBY_SIG_HOSTICE_BASE + RNetSignalType      (131..135)
 *
 * `flag` carries the negotiation id (1..255) the offerer chose for its
 * current agent. The answerer rebinds to a new id (a fresh agent) whenever an
 * SDP arrives with one it has not seen, and drops every signal stamped with a
 * stale id, so a guest that moves seats or retries after a failure cannot be
 * poisoned by its own earlier exchange.
 *
 * When a guest's agent reaches COMPLETED it sends the lobby
 * {"op":"path_report","path":"direct"[,"ice":"host|srflx|prflx"]} (the op the
 * server already accepts), refreshed every 45 s; on FAILED, path "fail", and
 * it retries with a fresh negotiation after 20 s. Every agent is FROZEN at
 * COMPLETED: no later SDP or candidate may rebuild a live link.
 *
 * At launch the lobby client hands the COMPLETED agents to the engine, which
 * adopts them into its session with rnet_session_start_ice_hub_adopt /
 * rnet_session_adopt_ice_agent (nothing is renegotiated). See
 * rnet_lobby_ice_take_hub / rnet_lobby_ice_take_guest_agent.
 *
 * Environment (test aids, so a loopback test can drive the real lobby client):
 *   RNET_HOST_ICE_BIND       bind every agent to this address (e.g. 127.0.0.1)
 *   RNET_HOST_ICE_NO_STUN    "1": no STUN server (host candidates only)
 *
 * Pump-driven like host_relay.h: no threads here, nothing blocks. Needs
 * RNET_ENABLE_ICE; without it rnet_host_ice_available() is 0, no agent is
 * ever created, and a guest reports path "fail" honestly.
