/*
 * The loadable netplay module.
 *
 * recomp-net (with retcomm-rbengine, and libjuice when built with ICE) can be
 * built as ONE shared library, `recomp_net_module`, that an engine or runner
 * loads at run time instead of linking. That lets the netcode be versioned and
 * updated without rebuilding the engine core.
 *
 * Three numbers describe a module; a loader checks them before it calls
 * anything else:
 *
 *   abi_version   The loader contract: which symbols exist and what their
 *                 structs look like. A loader built for ABI N accepts a module
 *                 whose abi_version == N and whose abi_minor >= the minor it
 *                 needs. The version moves only when a layout or signature
 *                 changes, and then every older loader refuses.
 *   abi_minor     Bumped when symbols or trailing struct fields are added.
 *   wire_version  The peer-to-peer protocol: RNET_WIRE_VERSION, the byte HELLO
 *                 carries (src/protocol/rnet_protocol.h). A session never
 *                 links with a peer of another wire version, so this is
 *                 already enforced on the wire; it is reported so a launcher
 *                 can say it beforehand. It is independent of the ABI: a wire
 *                 change that keeps the ABI still bumps it. Engines also fold
 *                 it into the identity they advertise
 *                 (rnet_rb_driver_set_identity), so the refusal is named.
 *
 * The module exports every public rnet_* and rbe_* function under its own
 * name, so a loader resolves them with dlsym/GetProcAddress. A loader that
 * cannot find a symbol it needs refuses the module by name; it never falls
 * back to a stub.
